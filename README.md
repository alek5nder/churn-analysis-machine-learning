# 🚀 Churn Analysis with Power BI & Machine Learning

Welcome to the Churn Analysis project! This repository demonstrates how interactive data visualization and machine learning can be combined to analyze and predict customer churn—enabling smarter business decisions and improved retention strategies.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for any organization, as it can directly affect profitability and long-term growth. This project leverages:
- **Power BI** for modern, interactive dashboards
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for data prep, analysis, and machine learning

You’ll find practical examples of how churn can be monitored, understood, and predicted using real-world methods.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **📊 Data Visualization (Power BI)**  
  Custom dashboards intuitively display churn trends, patterns, and correlations. Visual reports highlight at-risk customers, segment performance, and drivers behind churn.

- **🤖 Machine Learning (Python)**  
  Trained ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) predict customer churn probabilities. Feature importance analysis explains which variables matter most.

- **📈 Data-Driven Insights**  
  Deep analysis reveals behavioral patterns, customer segments likely to churn, and actionable metrics organizations can use to target interventions.

- **💡 Interactive Reporting**  
  Shareable Power BI reports enable business users to explore churn risk, slice by customer attributes, and assess what-if scenarios.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
- Basic familiarity with Power BI (for dashboard exploration)
- Python 3.x with key libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, (optionally: jupyter)
- Sample dataset (see `Customer_Data.csv` in repo)

**How to Use**
1. Open and review analysis steps in `Forecasting.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook):  
   - Data cleaning  
   - Exploratory analysis  
   - Model training & evaluation  
   - Export predictions to CSV
2. Load predictions and clean data into Power BI:
   - Explore provided dashboards (`Churn Analysis.pbix`)
   - Adjust and filter reports as needed

**Files Included**
- `Customer_Data.csv` – Source (raw) data
- `Forecasting.ipynb` – Machine learning & analytics notebook
- `Predictions.csv` – ML results, ready for dashboarding
- `Churn Analysis.pbix` – Final Power BI dashboard
- SQL/DAX/helper scripts (for advanced users)
